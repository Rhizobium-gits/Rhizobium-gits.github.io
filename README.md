# 【試作】Interactive 3D Profile - Tsubasa Sato

<strong><p>【Abstract】</strong></p>
Softly swaying information. Simple and intuitive. A fluctuating network existing between each element. Emotional. The presence of an axis. Self-formation born along the axis. Experiences emerging from zero. Birth. Memory. Memories and information of others that seem external but are not truly external. However, while one can perceive some of the information that constitutes another person, the network itself remains beyond recognition.
